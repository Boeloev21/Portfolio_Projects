## Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices in King County USA

Description: This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in King County, USA, based on various features such as the number of rooms, floor area, location, and other relevant factors. By analyzing a dataset containing historical housing information, the goal is to develop a model that accurately estimates the price of a house given its attributes. This predictive model can be valuable for real estate professionals, homebuyers, and sellers alike, providing insights into market trends and assisting in making informed decisions regarding property transactions in the King County area.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Libraries/Frameworks Used (Pandas, beautifulsoup, matplotlib)

## Project 3: SpaceX launch success prediction

Description: This project aims to predict the success or failure of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches by leveraging historical launch data from both the SpaceX API and the SpaceX launches Wikipedia page. The project unfolds through several key steps:

1. Data Collection: We gather launch data from the SpaceX API, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
2. Web Scraping: Additional data is extracted from the SpaceX Wikipedia page through web scraping techniques, enriching our dataset with contextual information.
3. Data Wrangling: The collected data undergoes meticulous wrangling to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility for further analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL: Utilizing SQL, we conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset,     
   facilitating a deeper understanding of launch dynamics.
5. EDA and Data Visualization: Further exploratory data analysis is performed, coupled with data visualization techniques, to visually represent key findings and 
   trends, making complex information more accessible and actionable.
6. Geographical Data Visualization with Folium: Geographical aspects of launch locations are visualized using Folium, enhancing our understanding of launch 
   distributions and their spatial relationships.
7. Machine Learning Classification Model: Finally, a machine learning classification model is developed to predict the success or failure of Falcon 9 launches 
   based on historical data. Leveraging features extracted from the dataset, the model offers insights into factors influencing launch outcomes and provides 
   valuable predictive capabilities for future missions.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Libraries/Frameworks Used (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Folium, Scikit-learn)

## Project 4: Binary Image Classification with Scikit-learn

Description:
This project aims to classify binary images into two distinct categories (people wearing masks, versus not wearing masks) using four different machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The project involves several critical steps:

1. Data Collection: We gather a dataset of binary images from relevant sources, ensuring a sufficient amount of data for training and testing.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected images undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and conversion to grayscale to ensure consistency and optimal performance of the models.
3. Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the images using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and pixel intensity values, transforming the images into a suitable format for model training.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Four different machine learning models—Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine—are trained on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. Each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine its performance.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters for each model are tuned to optimize performance, utilizing techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.
6. Model Comparison: The performance of the different models is compared using metrics like accuracy.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
